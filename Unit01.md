**Unit 1: Politics: Foundational Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*Our study of politics will begin with a review of the basic principles
of politics and various perspectives on how we define politics and its
domain.  We will discuss the changing notion of politics over time and
across cultures as we work towards a definition. *  
  
 *This unit will lay the framework for the remaining five units in this
course.  A confident and solid grasp of the principles presented in this
unit is therefore crucial to your progression through the remainder of
the course.  You will find, for example, that each of the five
subsequent units will conclude with a discussion of how the principles
you have learned and the issues you have identified apply to a
contemporary, real-life situation.  You will need to draw from the
foundational material you have learned in this unit in order to respond
to these applied situations.*

    Instructions: Read this article on the three authority types as
    defined by Max Weber, one of the foremost social theorists of the
    twentieth century.  The jurisdiction of political authority and the
    balancing of freedom and authority have been core questions from
    ancient times to the present. In many democratic societies, there is
    an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of
    governmental authority in general.  In the United States, for
    instance, there is a widespread belief that the political system as
    it was instituted by the Founding Fathers should accord the populace
    as much freedom as reasonable and that government should limit its
    authority accordingly.

     The central tenet of constitutionalism is that the authority of
    government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law
    (i.e., a written constitution).  However, as the article suggests,
    this theory brings with it a host of legal and philosophical
    questions on its use and practicality.
