     As a theory toward defining a key characteristic of the state,
    constitutionalism posits that government can and should be legally
    limited in its powers and that its authority depends on its
    observing these limitations.  Wormuth provides an analysis of
    ancient political thinkers’ classifications of various types of
    constitutional governments.  As a companion to the reading, it may
    be helpful to view this
