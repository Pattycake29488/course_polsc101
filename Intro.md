Course Syllabus for "POLSC101: Introduction to Politics"
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a survey course, and as such it can either be used by students
who are looking to take just one general overview course, or for
students who want to go on to more advanced study in any of the
subfields that comprise the political science discipline, such as
American politics, comparative politics, international politics, or
political theory.  This course will survey the different ways in which
political scientists study the phenomena of politics and will deepen
your understanding of political life as both a thinker and a citizen. 
The goal of this course is to introduce you to the discipline’s
concepts, terminology, and methods and to explore instances of applied
political science through real world examples. As an introductory
course, POLSC101 will focus on the basic principles of political science
by combining historical study of the discipline’s greatest thinkers with
analysis of contemporary issues.  We will also identify and discuss the
questions that perennially drive the field of political science,
including (among many others): “How do we define the changing nature of
power?,” “How do we differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate
governance?,” “What are the differences between political institutions
and political behavior?,” and “How do leaders define who gets to be
heard and counted in a political community?”  By the end of this course,
you will be familiar with these issues and capable of discussing them
within the context of contemporary politics.

    Notes](http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/klee/10lecture.htm)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to compete this course
successfully, you will need to work through each unit to read all of the
materials, gleaning the important ideas and taking notes.  Use the
Learning Outcomes below to help you identify important material.  Unit 1
covers introductory views into political philosophy; Unit 2 covers
political participation; Unit 3 covers political ideologies, with many
videos that bring them to life; Unit 4 covers the state, with a major
reading by Oppenheimer; Unit 5 covers political institutions; and Unit 6

order to adequately prepare for the exam, you will need to read through
the materials in this course and review any notes you took on these
resources.  In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or
higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it

 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **113
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you about 10 hours.  Perhaps
you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1
(a total of 2 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2.1 (a total of 4 hours)
on Tuesday and Wednesday; subunit 1.2.2 (a total of 3 hours) on
Thursday; etc.
