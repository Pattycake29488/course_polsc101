**Unit 5: Political Institutions** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit looks at the various forms of government a country can adopt
and how government forms the foundations of the institutions that
countries build.  Although this course tries to give a global
perspective on government, a lot of the specifics we will look at will
be from the perspective of the United States.*  
  
 *The Max Planck Manual has a global perspective and was written for the
people of the Sudan as they contemplate and hope for a future of
democracy and stability.  If you were from the Sudan, which would you
chose: federal or unitary relationships between the central government
and the local governments; a president or a prime minister to lead;
legislature or a parliament to make laws?  And what difference does it
make, anyway?  This unit will explore these types of questions.*

     The U.S. Congress is one of the world’s greatest democratic

     Public approval ratings for Congress typically hover around 30
    percent, and sometimes much lower.  Based on the Lee reading, what
    about Congress’ institutional design makes it such a target for
    criticism?

     The queen has a special relationship with the prime minister,
    regardless of his or her political party.  Although she is a
    constitutional monarch who remains politically neutral, the queen
    retains the ability to give a regular audience to a prime minister
    during his or her term of office and plays a role in the mechanics
    of calling a general election.  To date, there have been twelve
    prime ministers during the reign of the current British monarch,
    Queen Elizabeth II.

    branch is intended to function independently; thus, federal judges
    are appointed, not elected, and can serve for life.
