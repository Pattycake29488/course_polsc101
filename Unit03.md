**Unit 3: Ideologies** <span id="3"></span> 
**In this unit, we will be looking at the ideologies of the state and
its citizens.  Some of these ideologies reflect more on the state,
others on the people and their political parties, and others overlap the
two.  Some of these ideologies have only come into existence in the
twentieth century, while others go back hundreds of years.  Some
ideologies mean one thing in the United States and something different
to the rest of the world** – **for example, “liberalism.”  The following
subunit covers many of the traditional and best known ideologies,
however, the list is not all-inclusive.*  
  
 *Historically, the political spectrum was seen as one-dimensional, left
and right, representing the government’s position on the economic and
defense issues of the day.  But in the twentieth century, the New Deal
and other social issues led to the creation of another dimension,
confusing many who were trying to understand where they stood on both
the economic/defense issues and social issues.  At the end of this unit
you will be able to take a test and see where your political views fall
on the multidimensional political spectrum.**

    [“Democracy”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this encyclopedia entry.  Christiano
    provides a comprehensive analysis of “normative” democratic
    theories, which examines whether the claim of a state to a right to
    rule can be justified.  He also discusses some of the frustrating
    tensions between democratic ideals and their practice.

     Instructions: Please read this article.  The author points to the
    fact that democracy and socialism are often at odds with one
    another.  While both emphasize “equality” (political for the former
    and material for the latter), the fulfillment of one often comes at
    the expense of the other.  Do you agree with this assessment?  Why
    or why not?

    market economy subject to control by a democratic political system
    that is supported by the majority.  It stands in contrast to
    authoritarian capitalism by limiting the influence of special
    interest groups, including corporate lobbyists, on politics.*

     Instructions: Please click the link above and scroll down to the
    section called “National Socialism,”  and read the first section.
     In its intense nationalism, mass appeal, and dictatorial rule,
    National Socialism shared many elements with Italian fascism.
     However, Nazism was far more extreme both in its ideas and in its
    practice.  In almost every respect, it was an anti-intellectual and
    a theoretical movement, emphasizing the will of the charismatic
    dictator as the sole source of inspiration of a people and a nation,
    as well as a vision of annihilation of all enemies of the Aryan
    race.

    the life of Adolph Hitler and how Nazism took hold in pre-World War
    II Germany.  The beginning of the lecture references *Triumph of the

    Germany.  *Triumph* is one of the best-known examples of propaganda
    in film history.  Also remember that while the Nazi regime has its
    roots in fascism, National Socialism is the more accurate term used
    to describe the fully developed Nazi regime.

    radical Islam and its ties to terrorist activity (i.e., the 9/11
    attacks), much attention has been focused among Western leaders on
    both the resurgence and the future of Islamism.
