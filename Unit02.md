**Unit 2: Participation** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look at the participation of citizens in their
governments.  We are all born into a political culture, and our
political socialization begins as young as age 3, when we first learn
our attitudes toward police officers: think back, did you hear your mom
or dad say, “If you ever get lost, find a police officer, and they will
bring you home,” or did you hear from your car seat in the back, “Oh no!
Slow down! It’s the cops!”  One gives you a good feeling toward police,
and authority in general, while the other instills fear.  
  
 Our environment continues to shape our political opinions as we grow,
and when we become eligible to vote, we also decide whether to join
parties or interest groups or even whether or not to participate in
political marches or other forms of protest.  Some of us may grow up in
a political void and feel alienated, while others try to use the
government to promote racist and hate-filled agendas; when their voices
are rejected, or even “silenced,” they feel disenfranchised and resort
to violence.  In a democracy, hearing everyone’s voice is the goal, even
if we do not like what our fellow citizens are saying.*

     Instructions: Please read this article.  Fiorina captures the
    debate on the relative merits of political culture versus rational
    choice explanations for understanding political behavior.  For
    rational choice theorists, history and culture are irrelevant to
    understanding political behavior; instead, it is sufficient to know
    the actors’ interests (usually economic) and to assume that they
    pursue them rationally.

    proliferation of interest groups in the United States and its

     *Note: A* free-rider *is an economic term that refers to someone
    who receives benefits without incurring costs.  A free-rider is the
    result of a market failure, or externality, which makes something
    unprofitable in the free market.  For example: lobbying efforts are
    non-exclusionary, meaning no one can be excluded from the benefits
    of the lobbying regardless of whether they have paid to be a member
    of the lobbying group or not.  The result of the “free-rider”
    problem is that it increases the difficulty of attracting paying
    members.*

**2.4.2 Iron Triangle** <span id="2.4.2"></span>

    “Policy Change Networks, 1945-2008”**

    [“Policy Change Networks,
    1945-2008”](http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/pnconfs_2010/50/) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click the link above, and then click on
    “Policy Change Networks, 1945-2008” to download the PDF, and read
    the entire document.  While you read, be aware of Grossman’s
    methodology; it is typical of research done at the doctoral level.
     The theory of Iron Triangles, which Grossman refers to, was
    developed during the Eisenhower administration to explain the
    enviable success of the military-industrial complex in attaining
    their policy goals.  The theory says; if you coordinate the
    appropriate interest groups (defense contractors like Boeing and
    Lockheed-Martin) with the appropriate Congressional committees
    (Senate and House Armed Services Committees) and the appropriate
    Executive agencies (Department of Defense), they will act as one in
    successfully promoting policies.  Grossman’s theory of Policy Change
    Networks challenges whether the Iron Triangle theory was ever
    applied beyond the military-industrial complex.  And finally, all
    tables and figures are at the back of the article; tables are
    explanations for the figures, but it is the figures that will give
    you the visual understanding of how Policy Change Networks
    interact.
