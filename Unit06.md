**Unit 6: World Politics and Globalization** <span id="6"></span> 
**This unit traces the emergence of a world system of states from the
Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which first standardized the conditions for
peace among states, through the colonial period and into contemporary
globalization.  We will see that global governance has its roots both in
the economic interests of states and a general aversion to war.  For
instance, you will learn how economic interests led European powers to
expand their political control over** – **and ultimately establish
formal colonies (countries or areas under the political control of
another, distant country) in ** – **Africa, the Americas, and Asia.
European powers used their colonies both to extract raw materials for
the industrial revolution in Europe and the United States and to export
excess segments of their own populations.  From an economic perspective,
European colonization was exchanging excess Europeans for raw materials
like lumber, steel, tea, and crops.  This pattern of exchange has led to
complex political dynamics across state borders, the implications of
which continue to be felt today.*  
  
 *This unit will also consider how both trade and a series of
18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century European colonial mandates
eventually led to two world wars and the emergence of what we call the
Third World, those countries not included in the Soviet or United States
spheres of influence during the Cold War.  Subunit 6.2 introduces
security studies, which includes the political voices of indigenous
peoples in response to the drive toward globalization.  Subunits* *6.3
and 6.4 will focus on some of the emerging issues in global governance,
such as the burgeoning influence of nonstate actors and human rights.**

     Each ruler would have the right to determine their state's religion

    of Westphalia continues to be of importance today, with many
    academics asserting that the international system that exists today
    began at Westphalia.

     Since the creation of the United Nations, it has drawn controversy
    and criticism, directed mainly at the UN’s purported inability to
    handle international conflicts, even on a small scale.  Some have
    even questioned whether the UN might be relevant in the
    21<sup>st</sup> century, pointing to the fact that the requirement
    for unanimous consent on the authorization of UN enforcement actions
    has not always been reached in time to prevent the outbreak of
    international wars.  Do you agree or disagree with these
    assessments?  Why or why not?
